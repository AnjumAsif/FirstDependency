SSP - a scalable size unit for texts
An android SDK that provides a new size unit - ssp (scalable sp). This size unit scales with the screen size based on the sp size unit (for texts). It can help Android developers with supporting multiple screens.

This is the sibling of the sdp size unit that should be used for non text views.

Attention
Use it carefully! for example, in most cases you still need to design a different layout for tablets.

Example
Here is a single layout built using ssp:

ssp example

And here is the same layout built using sp:

sp example

You can see that ssp scales with the screen size and the sp stays with the same size on all screen sizes.
